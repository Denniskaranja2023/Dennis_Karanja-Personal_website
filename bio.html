        <p class="paragraph-bio ml-[3%] text-[1.25rem]">A BSc.Civil Engineering graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. The discipline of engineering trained me to think of creative ways of solving problems through appplication of scientific laws,modelling and experimentation. Over the years, I worked on different projects ranging from Water distribution networks, highway projects and construction of buildings</p>
        <p class="paragraph-bio ml-[3%] text-[1.25rem]">The impact of these close to four years of experience in the construction industry have helped me hone the following skills among many others:</p>

        <h1 class="mt-[1%] mb-[1%] heading text-[2rem]">Transition into Tech</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem]">In the year 2025, I took the bold move of transitioning into tech. It is no question that coding is one of the indispensable skills of our century and tech is the industry of the 21st century. I took the transition with the motivation of being relevant but that was not all. I also love to find meaning in my work by solving real life problems. Software engineering gives the tools necessary for solving problems not only in the construction industry but also in almost every sphere of human existence</p>
        <h1 class="heading text-[1.5rem] underline">Moringa School and tech</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem]">To kickstart my journey in tech, Moringa School six month bootcamp for Full stack software develpoment was one of the best if not the best options available. I enrolled into the program and made that transition</p>
        <p class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem]">Being diligent and keen to learn the art of coding I have also taken the line of self learning exploring various relevant courses online</p>
        <h1 class="heading text-[1.5rem] underline">My vision in tech</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem]">I have positioned myself to perfect my art so as to be a resourceful problem solver especially coming up with solutions for industries that are of my great interest including the construction and the music industry.I am however open to learning as I accelerate my growth in this profession </p>
