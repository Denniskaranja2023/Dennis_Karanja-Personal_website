        <p class="paragraph-bio ml-[3%] text-[1.25rem]">Everyone consciously or subconsciously have a personal mantra which they live by. It is a code by which they operate and this in a very great way influences how they act and why they do what they do. This page is meant to give you an insight on who I am outside of the professional side of things thpough it takes more than a statement to know someone. The mantra I live by is: <span class="text-amber-600">'Honour, love and respect'</span> by this I mean:</p>

      <div>
        <ol class="w-[100%] text-justify">
            <li class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem] bg-amber-50 rounded-2xl border border-solid border-black mt-[4%]"><span class="text-amber-900">Honour:</span>    That in all my dealings I have an obligation to act reverentially towards the Almighty God.</li>
            <li class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem] bg-amber-50 rounded-2xl border border-solid border-black mt-[4%] mb-[4%]"><span class="text-amber-900">Love:</span>    That I owe it to others to treat them with kindness and concern as I would myself desire to be treated.</li>
            <li class="paragraph-bio text-[1.25rem] bg-amber-50 rounded-2xl border border-solid border-black"><span class="text-amber-900">Respect:</span>    That all people, having an inherent value, are worth my respect despite their background or belief</li>

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Among many other things, I enjoy the following activities: </p>

        <h1>Family and Faith Community</h1>
        <p>A very important part of who I am is the community around me. That sense of community, ubuntu, is important to me. The truth is that no man is an Island. My family is a supportive pillar from which I have not only found a sense of belonging but also learnt the values of hardwork and integrity. Through the faith community I belong to I have also had the chance to serve, to give and to learn from others.</p>
        <p>I believe that these values that I have picked from community are very relevant even in my professional journey where values like respect and teamwork are important</p>

        <h1>Volunteering</h1>
        <img src="">
        <p>One thing that I have found particularly fulfilling in the course of life is volunteering. I have learnt that indeed there is a greater joy in giving than in receiving. I have had the privilege of volunteering with the following institutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <img src=""> FOCUS Kenya- Served for one year as a student ministry worker.</li>
            <li><img src=""> Missions of Hope International(MOHI)-Served for two months as a Primary SChool teacher</li>
